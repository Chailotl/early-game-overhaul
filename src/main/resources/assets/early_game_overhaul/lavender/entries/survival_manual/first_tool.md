Trees can only be harvested with axes in the same way that stone can only be harvested with a pickaxe, so to get started you'll need to craft a flint axe.

One problem you might notice is that to craft a flint axe you need a crafting table, and to get a crafting table you need wood, which you can only get with axes!


Fortunately we can break down this recipe into two easier-to-craft parts.

;;;;;

First, knap the flint into the shape of an axe head, then attach it to a shaft.

You can find sticks from breaking leaves, dead bushes, saplings, and bamboo.

Gravel sometimes drops flint when broken, and you can find it in river beds, ponds, and stony areas.


You can craft two gravel into flint in a pinch.
